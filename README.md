# CoreLinuxLocationKit
This is an implementation for part of Core Location for use in Linux for swift.  This is a temporary measure for open source swift as I am hopeful that Apple will open source part of Core Location in the future.  In the meantime you may use this for code portability purpose.

Currently only CLLocation and all it's dependencies are implemented.'
